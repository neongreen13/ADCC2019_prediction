 Project: predict match-level win/loss outcome at 2019 ADCC. 
 
The ADCC Championship happens every two years and is considered the Olympics of submission grappling. The 2019 event concluded with a bang in September and crowned some new and some veteran champions. As an exercise in data science, I thought it would be fun to take the results and see how accurate a machine learning model could predict if a match would end in a win or loss. Since we already have the winners, I won't be predicting a future outcome, but instead exploring which characteristics of the matches and the fighters factor into the results.
