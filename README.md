 Project: predict match-level win/loss outcome at 2019 ADCC. 
 
The ADCC Championship happens every two years and is considered the Olympics of submission grappling. The 2019 event concluded with a bang in September and crowned some new and some veteran champions. As an exercise in data science, I thought it would be fun to take the results and see how accurate a machine learning model could predict if a match would end in a win or loss. 

Two notebooks and accompanying data. One notebook for the exploratory data analysis and another on model prediction. With the given data, a tuned Logistic Regression model was selected and produced a 70% accuracy score.
